# MCP SQLPP Proxy - Product Summary

## Executive Overview

The MCP SQLPP Proxy (`mcp_sqlpp_proxy`) is a professional-grade Go-based middleware solution designed for Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic management and observability. This enterprise-ready proxy serves as a transparent intermediary between MCP clients and SQLPP MCP servers, providing comprehensive traffic logging, debugging capabilities, and protocol analysis tools essential for production MCP deployments.

## Product Positioning

**Target Market**: Development teams, DevOps engineers, and system administrators working with Model Context Protocol implementations requiring robust traffic monitoring, debugging capabilities, and compliance auditing.

**Primary Use Cases**:
- Production MCP traffic monitoring and analysis
- Development and testing environment debugging
- Compliance and audit trail generation
- Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification
- Security auditing of MCP communications

## Core Value Proposition

### üîç **Complete Traffic Visibility**
- Comprehensive logging of all MCP communications with unique session tracking
- Timestamped traffic capture for forensic analysis and debugging
- Zero-impact transparent proxying maintains protocol integrity

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Enterprise Configuration Management**
- Multi-layer configuration system supporting command-line flags, environment variables, and configuration files
- Flexible executable path specification for diverse deployment scenarios
- Production-ready defaults with extensive customization options

### üöÄ **Dual Transport Architecture**
- **Stdio Mode**: Seamless integration with command-line workflows and scripting environments
- **HTTP Mode**: RESTful proxy capabilities for web-based applications and microservice architectures

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Language**: Go 1.24.5+ for optimal performance and cross-platform compatibility
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies using industry-standard libraries (Viper, pflag)
- **Deployment**: Single binary deployment with zero external dependencies

### Enterprise Configuration Architecture
```yaml
# Professional multi-format configuration (YAML, JSON, TOML)
# Supports multiple file locations and environment-specific overrides
transport: stdio          # Transport protocol selection
port: 8099                # HTTP listener port  
xfer-port: 8891          # Upstream SQLPP server port
exe-path: ./mcp_sqlpp    # Configurable executable path
```

**Configuration Sources (Priority Order):**
1. Command-line flags (highest)
2. Environment variables (`MCP_PROXY_*`)
3. Configuration files (auto-discovery)
4. Built-in defaults (fallback)

### Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Professional CLI with comprehensive flag support
mcp_sqlpp_proxy --transport http --port 8080 --exe-path /usr/local/bin/mcp_sqlpp
```

  - `[HTTP IN]`/`[HTTP OUT]`/`[HTTP ERROR]` - HTTP transaction logging
  - `[DEBUG]` - Detailed debugging information
  - `[ERROR]`/`[FATAL]` - Error conditions and critical failures
- **Session Tracking**: Unique log files per run (`mcp_sqlpp_proxy_<pid>_<timestamp>.log`)
- **Request/Response Correlation**: Complete traffic analysis with body logging
- **Configuration Audit**: Full configuration logging for compliance and debugging

### üîß **Flexible Deployment Options**
- Containerized deployment with environment variable support
- System service integration capabilities
- Cloud-native architecture compatibility
- Multi-environment configuration management

### üéØ **Developer Experience**
