# MCP SQLPP Proxy Configuration
# This file demonstrates all available configuration options with their default values.
# You can use YAML, JSON, or TOML format for configuration files.

# Transport mode: "stdio" or "http"
# - stdio: Communicates via standard input/output (good for command-line tools)
# - http: Acts as HTTP proxy (good for web applications and services)
transport: stdio

# Port to listen on when using HTTP transport mode
# Only used when transport is set to "http"
# Default: 8099
port: 8099

# Port where the target mcp_sqlpp server is running (HTTP mode only)
# This is where the proxy will forward HTTP requests
# Only used when transport is set to "http"  
# Default: 8891
xfer-port: 8891

# Path to the mcp_sqlpp executable
# Can be absolute path or relative to current working directory
# Examples:
#   - ./mcp_sqlpp (relative path, default)
#   - /usr/local/bin/mcp_sqlpp (absolute path)
#   - ../gosqlpp-mcp-server/gosqlpp-mcp-server (relative to another directory)
# Default: ./mcp_sqlpp
exe-path: ./mcp_sqlpp

# Environment Variable Overrides:
# All configuration options can also be set via environment variables:
# - MCP_PROXY_TRANSPORT=http
# - MCP_PROXY_PORT=8080
# - MCP_PROXY_XFER_PORT=8891
# - MCP_PROXY_EXE_PATH=/usr/local/bin/mcp_sqlpp

# Command-line flags take the highest precedence and will override 
# both environment variables and config file values.
